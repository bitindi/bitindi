### Hi there üëã ‚ú®Bitindi Chain ‚ú®  *is a  An innovative layer 1 blockchain that aims to bring a shift in the blockchain ecosystem by introducing a next generation user-friendly development tools.*


## Framework

### Bitindi consists of an architectural framework with strong guarantees:


ü¶Ñ **Sustainability** - Bitindi Chain's main goal is to create a user-centric sustainability-driven ecosystem, and it is able to achieve this by having sustainability embedded inside the Bitindi Chain consensus mechanism and runtime logic. Thus, making sure that sustainable participation in the network or in the real world is highly incentivized.


ü¶Ñ **Security** - The cutting-edge technology that is used to build Bitindi Chain plus the BPoS allows Bitindi Chain to have strong security guarantees that other older blockchains lack.


ü¶Ñ **Scalability** -Bitindi Chain is able to achieve high transactional by shading and it enables the migration of real-world use cases that need high scalability promises on-chain.


ü¶Ñ **Democracy** - Older blockchains have no governance procedures and this has led to chain maximalism. Bitindi Chain's sophisticated and transparent governance mechanism allows everyone to democratically participate in the network and propose changes.


ü¶Ñ **Interoperability** - Bitindi Chain has the ability to interoperate with a variety of blockchains, enabling cross-blockchain transfers of any type of data through bridges.


## Problems Bitindi is Solving:

‚ÄºÔ∏è**Problem:** Fragmentation of liquidity due to lack of interoperability.

**Solution:** Bitindi will use the technology we have developed to be cross blockchain interoperability.


‚ÄºÔ∏è**Problem:** Lack of mass adoption due to a high knowledge barrier for non-crypto-native end-users. 

**Solution:** Bitindi will feature a mobile application & web application layer designed to bring non-crypto-users into the Bitindi ecosystem. Creating this mobile app & web application will allow Bitindi to tap into the demographic that mainly uses smartphones and smartphone applications. It will also allow us to create a simplified UI to bring in new users.


‚ÄºÔ∏è**Problem:** New projects cannot tap into cross-chain liquidity and multi-chain user base immediately to grow their projects from the start. 

**Solution:** Bitindi technology and inherent interoperability will allow new projects to list their tokens on all blockchains supported by Bitindi by listing on Bitindi Dex.
